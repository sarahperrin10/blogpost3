### What is art?
I created “The Duke Dunking Challenge” to provide a fun way for students to interact with and reflect on their time here as Cameron Crazies. The repetition of tents along the right and left side of the canvas and Coach K’s face along the top and bottom act as symbols for most students’ experiences with Duke basketball, and can represent how overwhelming this relationship is at times. In addition, in the same way that the user must move his/her mouse in order to play the game (getting Zion to dunk a basketball into a hoop), Duke students can choose how involved they want to be in the culture of Duke basketball. For instance, I have many friends that will be sleeping outside in tents for months in order to watch the Duke-UNC game. I, on the other hand, choose to be perfectly content watching the game from behind a television screen. We are each responsible for our own level of involvement. Overall, I think this work shows how stimulating, and often overpowering, basketball can be on Duke’s campus. And yet, behind the craziness, it is a game.

In watching the videos from ‘What is Art?’ my biggest takeaway was that many see their art as an extension of their selves or their own paths in life. For instance, Jeff Koons talks about art as a vehicle for acceptance, first of yourself and then of how you think about others. In addition, for many art is a lifelong, ardous journey, evidenced by Wolfgang Laib’s collection of pollen that began in 1977. He says that this takes courage: to work on the same project and collect the same pollen that he did thirty years ago. On the other hand, artist Hilary Lloyd’s pieces are not about the culmination of a long period of time, but rather are about very specific zoomed-in moments. Of course, each artist brings his/her own interpretation to this very big question. I think my own work, like many other artists, draws on my sense of self, and specifically how I see my four years here at Duke. It is a creation concerning my experiences and observations in the very immediate world around me.
